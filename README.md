Supported injections:
-
If the loader was built as 32 bit:
```
32 bit payload -> 32 bit target
```
If the loader was built as 64 bit:
```
64 bit payload -> 64 bit target
32 bit payload -> 32 bit target
```

How to use the app:
-
Supply 2 commandline arguments:

```
[payload_path] [target_path]
```

Payload is the PE to be executed impersonating the Target.
